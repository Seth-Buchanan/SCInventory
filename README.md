## Add and remove item quantities 
Wow! a cool new sleek minimal useful terminal user interface that that adds *and* removes items!

## None of that administration bloatware!
Our users know how to use sqlite3 to add and remove items from the table. I'll be adding a way for the program to detect if a database is not present and make a table.
