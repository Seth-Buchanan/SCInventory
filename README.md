# leinvetrorie
Nice little inventory system for all your inventory needs.

## Add and remove item quantities 
Wow! a cool new sleek minimal useful terminal user interface that that adds *and* removes items!

## None of that administration bloatware!
Our users know how to use sqlite to add and remove items from the table. I'll be adding a way for the program to detect if a database is not present and make a table.

# Build steps

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Seth-Buchanan/leinvetrorie.git

$ go build .
```

# Usage
``` bash

```

and most importantly, enjoy.
